The streets of Paris
I see you walkin' 'cross the street at night
The streets of London
I see your shadow moving city lights
I wanna spoil you
Being there for you
Never avoid you, swim up beside you
Ah-uhm-ba-eh, ah-uhm-ba-eh (come now)
In my illusion, you're all I see
Stuck in a notion, you stand by me
And for a second I thought I could see
My baby walk up on me
The streets of Paris
I see you walkin' 'cross the street at night
The streets of London
I see your shadow moving city lights
Can't get you off my mind
Under the bridges (oh, oh)
Memory glitches (do you see me?)
Silhouette dancing at the end of the ally (dancing)
Ah-uhm-ba-eh, ah-uhm-ba-eh (oh, hoh)
And for a moment I thought it could be (it could be)
For real and not just a dream (all in my head)
The streets of Paris
I see you walkin' 'cross the street at night (yeah, yeah, ooh)
The streets of London
I see your shadow moving city lights (oh)
Can't get you off my mind
I see you walkin' 'cross the street at night
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
I see your shadow moving city lights (city lights)
Can't get you off
The streets of Paris
I see you walkin' 'cross the street at night (street at night)
The streets of London
I see your shadow moving city lights (city lights)
Can't get you off my mind
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
I see your shadow moving city lights (city lights)
Can't get you off my mind
